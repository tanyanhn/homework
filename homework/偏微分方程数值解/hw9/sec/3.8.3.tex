\exc Consider the linearized one-dimensional 
Euler equations, where $U = 0$
and $R$ is a constant.
 Prove that the system represents two “sound-waves”
moving with the velocities $±a(R)$.


\begin{solution}
    By (3.7.5), take $u = U = \rho_x = v_x = 0$ the system is 
    \begin{align*}
      v_t &= V v_y +\frac{a^2(R)}{R} \rho_y \\
      \rho_t &= R v_y + V \rho_y
    \end{align*}
    Solve this get 
    \begin{align*}
      v &= \pm a(R)(y + (\pm a(R) + V)t) \\
      \rho &= R(y + (\pm a(R) + V)t)
    \end{align*}
\end{solution}

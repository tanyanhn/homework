\exc Consider the first-order system 
$u_t = Au_x$ . Is it possible that the Petrovskii
condition (3.1.12)
 is satisfied for some constant 
 $\alpha > 0$ but not for $\alpha = 0$?


\begin{solution}
    Assume $A$ is satisfied
    however exist eigenvalues $\lambda$ of 
    $\hat{P}(i\omega)$ such that 
    $0 < \text{Re } \lambda \leq \alpha$, take $v$ is 
    eigenvector of $\lambda$, so 
    \[\hat{P}(i \omega)v = i A \omega v = \lambda v\]

    that imply exist a eigenvalues $\lambda_1$
    have $ - \alpha / \omega \leq \lambda_1 < 0$. 
    Let $\omega \rightarrow + \infty  $, $\lambda_1$
    can't be a negative value. which is contradict with 
    $\lambda_1 < 0$.
\end{solution}

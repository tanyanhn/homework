\exc Is it true that Eq. (3.4.5) holds with the same 
constants $\delta ,K$, if the system
is changed to $u_t = Au_{xx} + Bu_{x} + Cu$, where B is Hermitian and C is
skew-Hermitian?


\begin{solution}
    $B, C$ not influence (3.4.5) holds with the same 
    constants, since stability of parabolic second 
    order system is independent of lower order term. 
\end{solution}

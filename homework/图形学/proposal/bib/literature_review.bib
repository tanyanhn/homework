   abstract = {After receiving his doctorate, Prandtl became a machine engineer at MAN in Nuremberg. He designed an extraction system for sawdust, which brought him close to the problem of flow separation. In 1901, he was appointed to the position of Professor of Mechanics at the technical university in Hanover. There, Prandtl developed the concept of the boundary layer, which he presented in 1904 at the Third International Mathematicians Congress in Heidelberg. In the same year, he was appointed Professor of Technical Physics at the University of Goettingen.},

abstract = {We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract = {The semantic image segmentation task presents a trade-off between test time accuracy and training time annotation cost. Detailed per-pixel annotations enable training accurate models but are very timeconsuming to obtain; image-level class labels are an order of magnitude cheaper but result in less accurate models. We take a natural step from image-level annotation towards stronger supervision: we ask annotators to point to an object if one exists. We incorporate this point supervision along with a novel objectness potential in the training loss function of a CNN model. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark reveal that the combined effect of point-level supervision and objectness potential yields an improvement of 12.9{\%} mIOU over image-level supervision. Further, we demonstrate that models trained with pointlevel supervision are more accurate than models trained with image-level, squiggle-level or full supervision given a fixed annotation budget.},

@article{Bell2013,
abstract = {The appearance of surfaces in real-world scenes is determined by the materials, textures, and context in which the surfaces appear. However, the datasets we have for visualizing and modeling rich surface appearance in context, in applications such as home remodeling, are quite limited. To help address this need, we present OpenSurfaces, a rich, labeled database consisting of thousands of examples of surfaces segmented from consumer photographs of interiors, and annotated with material parameters (reflectance, material names), texture information (surface normals, rectified textures), and contextual information (scene category, and object names). Retrieving usable surface information from uncalibrated Internet photo collections is challenging. We use human annotations and present a new methodology for segmenting and annotating materials in Internet photo collections suitable for crowdsourcing (e.g., through Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Because of the noise and variability inherent in Internet photos and novice annotators, designing this annotation engine was a key challenge; we present a multi-stage set of annotation tasks with quality checks and validation. We demonstrate the use of this database in proof-of-concept applications including surface retexturing and material and image browsing, and discuss future uses.

abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge is a benchmark in visual object category recognition and detection, providing the vision and machine learning communities with a standard dataset of images and annotation, and standard evaluation procedures. Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection. This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Content and Aims of this Book Earlier drafts of the manuscript of this book (James A. Boa was then coau thor) contained discussions of many methods and examples of singular perturba tion problems. The ambitious plans of covering a large number of topics were later abandoned in favor of the present goal: a thorough discussion of selected ideas and techniques used in the method of matched asymptotic expansions. Thus many problems and methods are not covered here: the method of av eraging and the related method of multiple scales are mentioned mainly to give reasons why they are not discussed further. Examples which required too sophis ticated and involved calculations, or advanced knowledge of a special field, are not treated; for instance, to the author's regret some very interesting applications to fluid mechanics had to be omitted for this reason. Artificial mathematical examples introduced to show some exotic or unexpected behavior are omitted, except when they are analytically simple and are needed to illustrate mathematical phenomena important for realistic problems. Problems of numerical analysis are not discussed. I. Introduction: General Concepts of Singular Perturbation Theory -- II. Layer-type Problems. Ordinary Differential Equations -- III.
